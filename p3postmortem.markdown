# Development Experience
## What went right in the development process?

### Communication
One positive aspect of our development process was the strong communication that we maintained throughout the term. We had no trouble scheduling meetings using Lettucemeet, as everyone worked hard to find times that fit our schedules. Each group member showed commitment to attending all of our scheduled meetings, such as opting to join virtually when they couldn't make it to campus. At the start of the term, we also set up a Discord group chat for our communication. This proved to be very helpful for updating each other on our progress and clarifying any questions regarding our assigned tasks. 

### Completing Assigned Tasks
Another positive aspect was the commitment of each group member to complete their assigned tasks. We dealt with challenges along the way but we approached all of them collaboratively. At no point did someone fail to meet a deadline and someone else needed to step in and complete a task for them. We regularly supported each other when necessary and ensured that everyone stayed on track with their responsibilities. 

## What went wrong in the development process?

### Adherence to Timelines
Although we aimed for soft deadlines for our tasks, we struggled to complete them on time due to everyone's various responsibilities. As a result, we often found ourselves working on the project in the final days before submission, pushing code to the main branch minutes before the 4:30PM deadline. However, we were all understanding of each other's situations. Despite the tight timelines, the pressure often resulted in very focused and productive work sessions because everyone was motivated to get the project finished on time.

## What would you do differently, if you had the chance to start over?

We would have liked to spend more time brainstorming features. While we're satisfied with most of what we created, some ideas could have been developed further. A few features turned out to be overly ambitious and, due to their complexity, we had to cut them out during the last iteration. Looking back, we would have preferred to hold another brainstorming session to explore features that are just as interesting but more manageable to implement.


## How did the project change from your initial (iteration 0) vision or stories, or did it work out as predicted?
Most of what we initially planned is still in place, with the exception of the feature that allowed users to see each other's availability and book times accordingly. We consider this a significant change as our project was originally built around this feature. Early in the term, this feature was a major topic of discussion as many group members considered it the standout feature of our entire project. We had intended to develop this feature in iteration 3. However, since that iteration was primarily focused on refactoring, we decided it wasn’t worthwhile to invest time in figuring it out.

Other minor adjustments involved revising our terminology, such as shifting our focus from "tasks" to "events." We separated the two and chose to use "events" as it made more sense because they could span over a specific period.

## What did you learn about team or large project development? What will you start doing, keep doing, or stop doing next time?

The main things that we learned working together as a group are the importance of communication and time management. Our meetings were very effective as it gave each member the opportunity to share their progress and any challenges they were facing. Being able to manage our time effectively was also another critical lesson as we were always rushing to complete tasks right before the deadline.

We will start setting clear, soft deadlines **and** hold each other accountable to help keep our project on track and remove the pressure of last-minute work. We also like the idea of implementing regular check-ins to help us monitor each other's progress. Just having quick 10-minute daily update could also help with making sure that everyone is aligned and aware of any priorities that have shifted. This could also help with getting group members to do their work if they knew they had to talk about it.

We want to continue to foster a supportive team environment. As we worked on this project, we realize how understanding each other's personal commitments helped maintain good morale. We’ll also keep encouraging collaborative problem-solving. Our brainstorming sessions were very effective when we needed to come up with solutions right away. Despite these brainstorming sessions being a result of leaving work to the last minute, they were very helpful when it came to debugging our code.

We’ll work on stopping procrastination by setting personal deadlines ahead of the actual ones to give us a buffer to fix up our code and address any issues. 

## Can you draw any conclusions from what you’ve done?

As a group, we concluded that effective teamwork relies on strong communication, mutual respect, and a shared vision For many of us, this class required a different level of teamwork compared to past group projects we've been part of. In other courses, we often just split up tasks and worked independently. This project showed us that being part of a team involves more than just completing assigned work but it requires active collaboration throughout the entire process.

Individually, we realized that software engineering may not be the right career path for some of us.
